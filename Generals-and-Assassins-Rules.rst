Setup
=====
Before play begins, each player must suffle their deck of cards and place it face down in easy reach. Discards should be placed face up next to the player's deck.

It may be advantageous to declare a player the bookkeeper, who is responsible for keeping track of HP and VP throughout the game. However you choose to keep track of things, each player starts the game with 50 HP and 0 VP.

Play
====
The game is divided into a series of rounds. The VP players acquire at the end of each round add to their total VP for the game.

At the beginning of each round, players have 50 HP, regardless of the outcome of the previous round. Each player draws five cards into their hand. If this is the first round of the game, determine randomly who plays first. Otherwise, the player who has the lowest total VP for the game plays first. Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

On their turn, players must play one (and only one) of the following actions: Attack, Assassinate, Buy Land, Heal or Discard.

* Attack

  - Players must play at least one General from their hand to attack an opponent. They may add any number of Generals and Soldiers from their hand to increase the DP of the attack. The combined value of all Generals and Soldiers played by the attacker is the total DP inflicted on the defender, if he does not defend.
  - Defending
    + The defender may play any Generals and Soldiers from his hand to reduce the DP inflicted upon him. 
    + The defender is NOT required to play a General.
    + In addition, all Lands the Defender has in play subtract two from the attack's DP.
    + The combined value of the Generals and Soldiers played by the defender, plus 2 DP for each Land he has in play, is subtracted from the attacker's DP and the result is the number of HP the defender loses.
  - Assisting
    + Players who are not the attacker or defender may assist either side with one General or Soldier from their hand, adding it to the total DP for the side they are assisting.
    + As an incentive to assist them, the attacker and defender may offer other players Lands they have played in exchange for their help.
  - All Generals and Soldiers involved in the attack and defence are discarded after the attack is resolved. All players must then draw back up to five cards.
 
* Assassinate

  - Assassins must be played alone. They cannot participate in regular attacks or be combined with Generals or Soldiers. 
  - Assassins inflict 25 DP on the defender if he does not defend. Assassins may only be defended against by playing another Assassin. This nullifies the attack. 

* Buy Land

  - Players may discard any number of Money cards from their hand to play any number of Land cards from their hand. The total value of Money cards discarded must be equal to or greater than the total value of all Land cards played. 
  - No change or refund is given if the Money discarded exceeds the total value of the Land played.
  - Players must place Land cards on the table in front of them so that other players may see their value clearly.
  - Players must discard any Money cards used to purchase Land cards and draw enough cards to bring their hand back up to five cards.

* Heal

  - A player may discard a single Healing card to regain its value in HP. Only one Healing card may be played per turn.
  - A player may never have more than 50 HP. Any excess HP gained from Healing are lost. 
  - After Healing, players must draw a card to bring their hand back up to five cards.

* Discard

  - If a player cannot or does not wish to perform any other action, he must discard any one card from his hand. 
  - If a player discards an Ace, he may discard any number of other cards along with it as long as he shows the Ace to the other players.
  - After discarding, a player must draw back up to five cards.

End of Round
============
The round can end in one of two ways:

1. If a player draws the last card from their deck, each player gets one more turn. Then the round ends.
2. If a player is reduced to 0 HP, the round ends immediately.

If there is no winner declared at the conclusion of this round, players must reshuffle their decks, reset their HP to 50 and begin the next round.

Scoring
=======
At the end of a round, each player sums the value of the Land cards they played. This sum is their VP total for the round. Each player adds this sum to their VP total for the game, unless their HP was reduced to 0, in which case, the player does not gain any VP for the round. His VP go to the player that defeated him instead.
